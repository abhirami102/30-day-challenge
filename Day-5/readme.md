# Day 5: Multiplication Table
## Task: Use loops and variables to generate a multiplication table.

Description:
Multiplication tables are a great way to practice working with loops and variables in Python. Using a for loop, you can generate the multiplication table for any number.
Question:

Write a Python program that does the following:

    Define a variable num and assign it any integer value.
    Use a for loop to calculate and display the multiplication table for that number, from 1 to 10.
    Display each result in the format: num x i = result.
