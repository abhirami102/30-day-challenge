# Day 4: Even or Odd
## Task: Use conditional statements to check if a number is even or odd.

Description:
In Python, a number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. Otherwise, it is odd. We can use the modulus operator % to check this condition.
Question:

Write a Python program that does the following:

    Define a variable num and assign it any integer value.
    Use an if-else statement to check if the number is even or odd.
    Display the result in the format:
        "The number X is even."
        "The number X is odd."
