# Day 7: Prime Number Checker
## Task: Use conditional statements and loops to determine if a number is prime.

Description:
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers.

To check if a number is prime:

    A number is not prime if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
  ## Question:

Write a Python program that does the following:

    Define a variable num and assign it any integer value greater than 1.
    Use a loop and conditional statements to determine if the number is prime.
    Display the result in the format:
        "The number X is a prime number."
        "The number X is not a prime number."
