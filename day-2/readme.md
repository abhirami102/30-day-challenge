Day 1: Variables and Basic Arithmetic
Task: Use variables to store and manipulate data.

Description:
Variables in Python allow you to store and work with data throughout your program. You can assign values to variables using the = operator. Once assigned, you can use these variables to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Question:
Write a Python program that does the following:

    Define two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them any integer values.
    Calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient, and store each result in a separate variable.
    Display each result with a label (e.g., “The sum is 15”).

Example:
```python

#Define variables
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

#Perform calculations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

#Display results with labels
print("The sum is", sum_result)
print("The difference is", difference_result)
print("The product is", product_result)
print("The quotient is", quotient_result)
