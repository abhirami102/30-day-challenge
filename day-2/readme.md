Day 1: Variables and Basic Arithmetic
Task: Use variables to store and manipulate data.

Description:
Variables are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated later in a program. In Python, you can create a variable by assigning a value to a name using the = sign. You can then perform arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) on these variables.

Question:
Create a Python program that does the following:

    Define two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them values of your choice.
    Calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient, and store each result in a new variable.
    Display each result with a label describing the operation performed (e.g., “The sum is 15”).

Example Code:

# Define variables
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Perform calculations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Display results with labels
print("The sum is", sum_result)
print("The difference is", difference_result)
print("The product is", product_result)
print("The quotient is", quotient_result)
