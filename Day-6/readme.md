# Day 6: Factorial Calculation
## Task: Use loops and variables to calculate the factorial of a number.

Description:
The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted as n! and calculated as:

    n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1
    By definition, 0! = 1.

Question:

Write a Python program that does the following:

    Define a variable num and assign it any non-negative integer value.
    Use a loop to calculate the factorial of the number and store the result in a variable called factorial.
    Display the factorial with a label (e.g., "The factorial of 5 is 120").
